# Armbian for Amlogic S9xxx STB

Compile the Armbian for Amlogic S9xxx STB, and extract the kernel for OpenWrt.

The extracted kernel storage path for openwrt is in the `build/output/images` directory, and the file name is `amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt-kernel-*.tar.gz`. The kernel can be used in the [amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt's kernel](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/tree/main/amlogic-s9xxx/amlogic-kernel/kernel).
